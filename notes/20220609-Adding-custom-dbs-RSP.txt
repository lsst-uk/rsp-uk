# Notes on adding Databases to the RSP


# ---------------------
# Step 1:
# ---------------------
 
Manually create felis (yml) configuration files for the catalogue metadata that we want to add

# https://github.com/lsst/sdm_schemas

# Felis:

Felis is a way of describing database catalogs, scientific and otherwise, in a language and DBMS agnostic way. It's built on concepts from JSON-LD/RDF and CSVW, but intended to provide a comprehensive way to describe tabular data, using annotations on tables, columns, and schemas, to document scientifically useful metadata as well as implementation-specific metadata for database management systems, file formats, and application data models.




# ---------------------
# Step 2:
# ---------------------

Build a tap-schema image that includes these yml files in the build process

To do this, I checkout out the code at:
  https://github.com/lsst/sdm_schemas/blob/main/tap-schema/build
and modified the build script to build the image as stvoutsin/tap-schema and push there

To build the schema for our environment, I ran the following command:
./build roe ../yml/dp01_dc2.yaml ../yml/dp02_dc2.yaml .. (include any new yaml/felis for the new catalogues we are adding here)



# ---------------------
# Step 3
# ---------------------

Modify our tap-schema service in the phalanx repo that we have forked & are deploying from to use the image we created
(see: https://github.com/LSP-UK/phalanx/blob/feature/uk-qserv/services/tap-schema/values-roe.yaml)


# Note: I have asked them whether there is a tool for building these yml files from an SQL database directly or .sql file, but they didn't seem to have any tools for this

# It would probably be helpful or even necessary to build a script to transform .sql files to .yml files for the catalogue metadata



# ---------------------
# Step 4
# ---------------------

Redeploy the RSP
