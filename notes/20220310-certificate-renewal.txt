# The following describes the process followed in order to update the expiring certificate for the RSP
# Unfortunately not automated, and contains mostly manual actions.


# Generating a new certificate
# -----------------------------------------------

# Email from the JISC team after question on Certificate renewal

"""
Hi Stelios

You can submit your certificate request through our portal:

Https://ca.is.ed.ac.uk/

Or you can speak to your own SoPA Helpdesk, as I think some of them are set up as users on the JISC service.

"""

# After filling out the certificate request through the portal for the domain: rsp.lsst.ac.uk, I got an automated message containing the certificate:


Certificate Details:
    Common Name :  rsp.lsst.ac.uk
    Subject Alternative Names : rsp.lsst.ac.uk

       as PKCS#7

    Issuing CA certificates only:
       as Root/Intermediate(s) only, PEM encoded
       as Intermediate(s)/Root only, PEM encoded


# Download a copy of the Certificate (w/ chain) to local machine



# Get Chain certificate
# -----------------------------------------------


# Use service at https://whatsmychaincert.com/ to get a copy of the chain certificate.
# Note that I tried all available formats of the certificate in the RSP, but it was only after running it through the tool that I got a version that worked.



# Update the ingress-certificate Secret in Kubernetes
# -----------------------------------------------------

# Log into Rancher Dashboard and navigate to our cluster
# Navigate to Storage / Secrets
# {dashboardURL}/explorer/secret/ingress-nginx/ingress-certificate#data
# Click "Edit Config" and paste the new Private key & Certificate


# Restart ingress-nginx controller pod
# -----------------------------------------------

# Log into Rancher Dashboard and navigate to our cluster
# Navigate to Workload / Pods / 
# Under the Ingress-nginx namespace find ingress-nginx-controller pod, and Delete it
# Kubernetes will then generate a new pod, containing the new certificate



# Validate certificate
# -------------------------------------------------

# Navigate browser to https://rsp.lsst.ac.uk and check certificate
